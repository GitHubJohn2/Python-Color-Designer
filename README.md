Tl# Python-Color-Designer
A three scale selector (red, green, blue) that produces a composit and it's hex triplet value.
This file has several intended uses:
First, it functions as what it is. Suppose you need to match a color in a jpg shown on a windows machine.  You could
open "3 color controler GRID" (that's the actual name of the file) and work with the red, blue and green mix until
you have a visual match, then you would also have the value (0-255) of RBG as well as the hex triplet for the composite color.
Second, the well documented file demonstrates a lot of widget implementation plus the grid geometry in tkinter (note: NOT
Tkinter).
Third, it is my future intention to integrate an external circuit with a tri-color LED and a software implementation of PWM
using RPi.GPIO to expand the function of the program to a real-world connection.
Fourth, I have a hunch this program is very inefficient and can provide lots of room for someone to sharpen their claws and
teach this newbie a thing or two.  I would appreciate it.
